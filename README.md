# Jav_Music_Player_Application
I developed a Java-based Music Player application that enables users to play, manage, and enjoy songs in various languages. The program allows users to select a preferred language, filters songs accordingly, and provides controls for play, pause, resume, next, previous, replay, and song deletion. It incorporates object-oriented design, employs Java collections for data management, and features a command-line interface for user interaction. This project demonstrates my proficiency in Java programming, OOP principles, and user-centric application development
